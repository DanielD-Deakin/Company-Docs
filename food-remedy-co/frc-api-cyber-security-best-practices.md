**21st August, 2023**

## Introduction - Security Auditing

A security audit is a systematic process that calculates and checks an organizationâ€™s or a system's security posture, practices, and controls to detect vulnerabilities, assess risks, and ensure compliance with policies, books, and security standards. This involves a comprehensive review of security configurations, processes, procedures, and technologies to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement. The goal of a security audit is to improve the overall security of the organization and reduce the possibility of a security breach or incident. Security auditing can be conducted internally by an organization's own security team or externally by independent auditors. It may involve automated tools for vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and log analysis, as well as manual assessments by experts. The results of a security audit are typically documented in an audit report, which outlines findings, risks, and recommendations for improving security measures.

## Key Aspects of Security Auditing

- **Risk Assessment:** Identifying potential risks and threats to the organization's assets, data, and infrastructure.
- **Review of Policies and Procedures:** Evaluating the organization's security policies, guidelines, and procedures to ensure they are comprehensive and up-to-date.
- **Access Controls:** Assessing the effectiveness of access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.
- **Data Protection:** Examining data storage, encryption, and handling practices to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Network Security:** Evaluating firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Application Security:** Assessing the security of applications, including code quality, vulnerability assessments, and secure coding practices.
- **Configuration Management:** Reviewing system and network configurations to ensure they align with security best practices.
- **Physical Security:** Reviewing physical access controls to data centers and other critical facilities.
- **Incident Response:** Evaluating the organization's incident response plan and its readiness to address security incidents.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with industry regulations and legal requirements.

## Accidental Exposure using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

### 1. GitHub Repository Scrutiny:

- Attackers scan GitHub repositories for commits containing keywords like "password," "key," or "token."
- Tools like TruffleHog and GitRob can search repositories for sensitive information.
- Example: An attacker finds a commit in a public repository with a plaintext AWS access key.

### 2. Code Sharing Platforms:

- Developers sometimes share code snippets containing credentials on platforms like Pastebin or Gist.
- Attackers use Google Dorks (advanced search queries) to find publicly shared credentials.
- Example: A developer inadvertently shares a Python script with hardcoded API keys on Pastebin.

### OSINT Tools

- **TruffleHog:** Searches for high entropy strings and keywords in Git repositories.
- **GitRob:** Scans GitHub repositories for exposed sensitive information.
- **Google Dorks:** Custom search queries to find specific information using Google's search engine.

### Scraping Tools

- **Web Scrapers:** Tools like Scrapy or Beautiful Soup automate data extraction from websites.
- **Malicious Bots:** Attackers deploy malicious bots to scrape and collect data from websites.

### Advanced Google Search

Advanced Google search techniques can help you identify instances of security hardcoded credentials online.

- **Identify Keywords:** Start by identifying relevant keywords that are commonly used in hardcoded credentials. These could include terms like "password," "secret," "API key," "access token," etc.
- **Use Quotation Marks:** Wrap your search terms in quotation marks to search for exact phrases. For example, search for "password=12345" or "API key=abcdef".
- **Exclude Common Pages:** To avoid common pages like documentation and tutorials, you can exclude specific domains from your search. For example, -site:github.com will exclude results from GitHub.
- **File Type Search:** Search for specific file types that often contain configuration files with hardcoded credentials. Use the filetype: operator, such as filetype:xml password.
- **Inurl Operator:** Use the inurl: operator to search for specific terms in the URL of a page. For example, inurl:config secret.
- **Wildcard Operator:** Use the * wildcard to capture variations of a term. For instance, "API key=*" will search for different API key values.
- **Intitle Operator:** Use the intitle: operator to find pages with specific terms in their title. For example, intitle:"login credentials".
- **Boolean Operators:** Combine operators like AND, OR, and NOT to refine your search. For example, password OR "API key" NOT tutorial.
- **Search Specific Domains:** Target specific domains that might be relevant to your search, like specific websites or forums where developers discuss code.

**Example:** "password=12345" OR "API key=abcdef" -site:github.com -site:stackoverflow.com filetype:xml

Additionally, you might consider using dedicated tools and platforms designed for searching for leaked or exposed credentials on the internet, as they can provide more focused and comprehensive results. Examples of such tools include Shodan, Censys, and Have I Been Pwned.

### Points to Keep in Mind

1. **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**

- Use environment variables or secure credential stores instead of hardcoding keys.
- Implement secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault.

2. **Regular Scanning:**

- Regularly scan code repositories and web platforms for sensitive data.
- Use automated tools like GitGuardian to monitor repositories for exposed credentials.

3. **Gitignore and .gitkeep:**

- Properly configure your .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files from version control.
- Use .gitkeep files to ensure empty directories are not accidentally committed.

4. **Security Awareness:**

- Train developers and team members about secure coding practices and the risks of accidental exposure.

## Mismanagement of IAM Policies and Security Misconfigurations

### 1. Overly Permissive IAM Policies:

- Scenario: Assigning broad permissions to users or roles, allowing unintended access to sensitive resources.
- Risk: Unauthorized access, data leakage, and potential compromise of critical resources.

### 2. Lack of Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):

- Scenario: Assigning excessive permissions beyond what's necessary for a user's role.
- Risk: Increased attack surface, potential for privilege escalation, and data breaches.

### 3. Unrestricted External Access:

- Scenario: Allowing open access to resources from any IP address.
- Risk: Exposure to attacks from malicious actors, such as DDoS or unauthorized data exfiltration.

### 4. Inadequate Logging and Monitoring:

- Scenario: Failing to set up proper logging and monitoring for IAM actions.
- Risk: Difficulty in detecting unauthorized or suspicious activities, hindering incident response.

### 5. Unused Credentials and Access Keys:

- Scenario: Leaving unused IAM users, roles, or access keys active.
- Risk: Increased attack surface, potential for unauthorized access, and resource wastage.

### Managing IAM Policies and Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):**

- Practice: Assign minimal permissions required for each user or role.
- Benefit: Reduces potential damage in case of a compromise and limits lateral movement.

2. **Regularly Review and Update Policies:**

- Practice: Conduct periodic reviews of IAM policies and permissions.
- Benefit: Ensures that permissions are aligned with users' roles and responsibilities.

3. **Use Managed Policies:**

- Practice: Utilize AWS-managed policies or create custom policies based on the principle of least privilege.
- Benefit: Ensures that policies follow best practices and are regularly updated by AWS.

4. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
