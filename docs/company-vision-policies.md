At Gopher Industries, we believe in a flat structure that encourages group leadership and contributions. We do not have traditional roles like CEOs or CTOs. Instead, we focus on contributions made by students (you guys!) to our products.
#### Our Operations: "The Three C's"
Our operations are based on what we call "The Three C's": Code, Communication, and Coordination.
#### 1. Code

We use GitHub as our code repository. All our product repositories are housed in a company-wide GitHub Organization. We have Git Leads who help manage this and coordinate activities and agreed policies. If you have a good knowledge of GitHub, you can contribute significantly in this area.
Here are our Git Leads: EREENA BAGGA and JYHE MARK

#### 2. Communication

We use MS Teams for direct communication with students and for updates about events. We have Comms Leads who manage this communication. They also make the Company-wide OnTrack submissions.
Here are our Comms Leads: VANESSA JOSEPHINE MATTEA

#### 3. Coordination

We use Trello as our main source of truth for all things we are working on. It provides clear visibility of all activities happening in Gopher Industries. We adopt a SCRUM framework tailored to our needs. Product Backlog Leads are required to manage the product backlog on each of the Trello boards.
Our Trello Workspace is here: https://trello.com/invite/gopherindustries3/ATTIfc98e6ebf94d61601f09d91a7ce2e06e82383EF8
