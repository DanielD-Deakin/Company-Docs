## Company Structure and Projects Overview
Gopher Industries has been totally restructured as it now functions as company then team based. As with the previous suite of seven products being reduced to two major products plus a new minor product. This new structure aims to implement changes to improve group leadership and the call for Contributions among students. There have been several changes to Gopher, with a focus on group leadership and the call for Contributions among students to our products.

The three Cs are:
1.  Code: We have revamped the Company-wide GitHub organisation to centralise the repos for all our products. This will be done primarily by the Git Leads, using a gopher@deakin.edu.au email as the main login credential.
2.  Communication: We need to clean up our MS Teams site, as there are too many channels and the files in SharePoint seem messy. We would be using Trello as our main source of truth for all things we are working on.
3.  Coordination: The Trello is used as our main source of truth for all things we are working on. Using Trello to coordinate our activities creates clear visibility to all things happening in Gopher and is useful and powerful tool for product development. We need to propagate this message among the Gopher company. We would have two major products and maybe a third as a minor product. With 50 students, we will likely have 10 super engaged students, 10 intermittent but dependable students, 10 students who are keen but do not have high technical skills, 10 that show up mid-trimester, and 10 you never see.

Some important things to be noted are:

**Backlog Leads:** There would be Product Backlog Leads identified who could start populating the product backlog on each of the Trello boards. This is 80% of the nuts and bolts of getting a SCRUM plan started.

**Product Meeting Schedule:** With the leads identified, we will organise a meeting each week, preferably Monday or Tuesday, for each product. This needs to be clearly linked somewhere.

**GitHub Leads:** We need to find and source students with a good knowledge of GitHub to consolidate our code repos in one organisation on GitHub with clear rules and policies. This is a big job, and the student(s) who take on this role will demonstrate considerable leadership and have great evidence for their portfolio.

**FAQ:** Development of a Comprehensive Gopher FAQ This will be the go-to for any student who has just joined or needs to know how we operate in the future. The new Gopher FAQ should be edited and expanded on, and it will help reduce questions coming to leadership students and give you a place to direct most student enquiries.

### NutriHelp
#### Overview, Goals and Objectives
Our company's focus is to assist the aging population. NutriHelp, our diet planning application, is designed to help users take control of their nutrition. To achieve this goal, our team, Task Force X, is developing a mobile application that tracks and recommends recipes based on user needs and preferences. As people age, their nutritional requirements change, and they may need to manage health issues. Our product aims to simplify this management by allowing users to input data during onboarding, then generate recommended meals and foods that can be added to their calendars. Users can also add their own foods to see how their current diet compares to their nutritional requirements. To incentivize user engagement, we plan to partner with online grocers to offer rewards for active users. NutriHelp empowers users to take control of their health and potentially reduce the risk of nutrition-related health issues, benefiting all stakeholders involved.

The goal of product development in Trimester 2 2023 is to commence development of the recommender system, continue implementation of the NutriHelp application, and we will also continue Research and Development on a major new feature of the application; a product scanner that users utilise to assess food products for suitability against their loaded dietary preferences, allergies and disease or health condition requirements.
